# Choices of this package

```@meta
CurrentModule = Runes2P
```

A choice of this package is a value or a default that neither DREAM's examples nor a cited reference fixes.
The code marks each one where it is set and points to this page.
Where a reason is stated, the column Notes gives it.
Where DREAM behaves differently, the option that reproduces DREAM is named below the table.

## Kinetic operator

| Choice | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| synchrotron loss of the Fokker–Planck operator | `synchrotron = true` ([`add_synchrotron!`](@ref)) | chosen for accuracy |
| interpolation scheme of [`fokker_planck_operator`](@ref) in `p` and `ξ` | `scheme = :exponential_fitting` ([`AdvectionDiffusion`](@ref)) | chosen for performance and positivity |
| lag of the plasma of a [`FokkerPlanckTerm`](@ref) that reads unknowns | `lagged = :ions` | - |
| boundary of [`fokker_planck_operator`](@ref) at `p_max` | `p_upper_boundary = :f_zero`, DREAM's `BC_F_0` | - |

The synchrotron default holds for [`fokker_planck_operator`](@ref), [`set_fokker_planck_coefficients!`](@ref) and a [`FokkerPlanckTerm`](@ref) that rebuilds an operator built otherwise.
DREAM leaves the synchrotron loss out by default, which `synchrotron = false` reproduces.
The properties of exponential fitting are on the page [Positivity and flux limiters](model/positivity.md#Exponential-fitting).
DREAM's default is the central interpolation, `scheme = :central`.
With `lagged = :ions` the charge-state densities enter the collisions of `f` at the start of the step, and the stored Jacobian has no columns of them.
The lag makes the term first order in time under BDF2, and [`ode_function`](@ref) passes no Jacobian for a system with such a term ([`Runes2P.lags_in_ode_form`](@ref)).
DREAM's default boundary at `p_max` is `BC_PHI_CONST`, which `p_upper_boundary = :constant_flux` reproduces.

## Collision frequencies

The rows are fields of [`CollisionSettings`](@ref).

| Choice | Value |
|---|---|
| window of partial screening, in units of the mean excitation energy ``I_j`` | `screening_window_start = 1`, `screening_window_end = 4` (with `screening_window = :excitation_energy`) |
| radiative stopping on the nuclei | `bremsstrahlung = :stopping_power` ([`bremsstrahlung_cross_section`](@ref)) |
| energy diffusion of the radiative stopping | `bremsstrahlung_diffusion = :none` |
| width of the threshold of the kinetic ionization in the friction | `ionization_threshold_width = 0.1` |

The partial screening is that of L. Hesslow et al., Journal of Plasma Physics 84, 905840605 (2018), [doi:10.1017/S0022377818001113](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022377818001113).
The bound-electron parts of charge state ``j`` enter through a smooth step in the kinetic energy from ``I_j`` to ``4 I_j``, and below it the screening is complete.
`screening_window = :dream` applies partial screening at all momenta, as DREAM does.
`bremsstrahlung = :neglect` leaves the radiative stopping out, as DREAM does by default.
With `bremsstrahlung_diffusion = :none` the radiative stopping is a pure drag, as in the model of M. Hoppe et al., Computer Physics Communications 268, 108098 (2021), [doi:10.1016/j.cpc.2021.108098](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2021.108098), eqs. 8, 9, 14 and 15.
`bremsstrahlung_diffusion = :dream` gives the radiative drag a thermal energy diffusion ``\Theta \gamma \nu_s``, as DREAM does.
With a threshold factor `ionization_threshold` above zero, the kinetic ionization starts at ``p_0 =`` `ionization_threshold` ``\sqrt{2T/m_e c^2}``.
Its weight in the friction rises in a cubic smooth step from ``(1 - w) p_0`` to ``(1 + w) p_0``, with ``w =`` `ionization_threshold_width`, a numerical width without a counterpart in DREAM.

## Kinetic ionization

| Choice | Value |
|---|---|
| cross sections of [`ionization_cross_section`](@ref), [`KineticIonizationTerm`](@ref) and the friction of [`CollisionSettings`](@ref) | `form = :chianti`, and `ionization_cross_section_form = :chianti` of the term and of the settings ([`chianti_cross_section`](@ref)) |
| energy above which CHIANTI's cross section follows the relativistic Bethe form | [`CHIANTI_MATCHING_ENERGY`](@ref) = 100 keV |
| factor of the window of the weight between the continued fit and the Bethe form | [`CHIANTI_MATCHING_WIDTH`](@ref) = 2 |
| weight of the relativistic rise of each shell and transition of [`chianti_cross_section`](@ref) | ``1 - 1/u``, ``u = \beta^2/\beta_I^2`` |
| spectrum of the secondaries of [`SecondaryHeatingTerm`](@ref), [`ionization_energy_flows`](@ref) and the friction of [`CollisionSettings`](@ref) | `spectrum = :beb`, `secondary_spectrum = :beb` ([`beb_mean_secondary_energy`](@ref)) |
| smallest threshold factor of the split of the ionization with a fluid term | [`MINIMUM_SPLIT_THRESHOLD_FACTORS`](@ref): 7 for `:chianti`, 5 for `:dream` and `:bethe` |
| part of the Maxwellian below a threshold that lies in the first momentum cell, in the split of [`Runes2P.threshold_split`](@ref) | the weight of that cell, ``M_1 w_1 / \sum M w`` |

The cross sections are the fits of the CHIANTI database, cited on [Home](index.md#Citing-and-acknowledgements), whose ionization data are those of K. P. Dere, Astronomy and Astrophysics 466, 771 (2007), [doi:10.1051/0004-6361:20066728](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:20066728).
These fits are nonrelativistic.
[`chianti_cross_section`](@ref) evaluates them at the speed of the electron and adds the relativistic rise.
The weight of the rise starts at zero at the threshold of each shell, with ``\beta_I`` the speed of an electron at the threshold energy.

Above the matching energy ``E_m =`` [`CHIANTI_MATCHING_ENERGY`](@ref) the cross section is the relativistic Bethe form.
A cubic weight in ``\ln E`` from ``E_m/2`` to ``2 E_m`` joins it to the continued fit.
The elements without CHIANTI data in [`CHIANTI_IONIZATION_FITS`](@ref) keep DREAM's form.
`form = :dream` takes DREAM's form for every element.

The spectrum of the secondaries is the binary-encounter-Bethe spectrum of Y.-K. Kim and M. E. Rudd, Physical Review A 50, 3954 (1994), [doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.50.3954](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.50.3954).
It takes the ionization energy of a charge state as its binding energy.
`spectrum = :opal` takes the spectrum of C. B. Opal, W. K. Peterson and E. C. Beaty, The Journal of Chemical Physics 55, 4100 (1971), [doi:10.1063/1.1676707](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1676707).
It takes the width of the neutral element in [`SECONDARY_SPECTRUM_WIDTHS`](@ref) for every charge state.

The split at the threshold divides the ionization between the kinetic term and a fluid term.
The fluid coefficient of the split ([`fluid_ionization_coefficient`](@ref)) has no floor, so with a Maxwellian `f` the kinetic and fluid rates add up to the ADAS rate.
Where the threshold lies in the first momentum cell, [`Runes2P.threshold_split`](@ref) takes the part below it, ``1 - f_>``, as the weight of that cell.
At the threshold factors of the split nearly the whole Maxwellian then lies in that cell, below the threshold, and the fluid coefficient stays finite.
There the two rates add up to the ADAS rate only to within that part, and a warning names the radius and the temperature.

At a threshold factor below that of its form, [`IonRateTerm`](@ref) and [`RadiatedPowerTerm`](@ref) refuse the split.
The factor 5 is the hot-region threshold of DREAM's disruption example.
The default hot region of [`ThermalMomentum`](@ref) takes 7 for every form.

## Atomic data and radiation

| Choice | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| continuation of the ADAS coefficients outside the tables, in [`adas_coefficient`](@ref), [`IonRateTerm`](@ref) and [`RadiatedPowerTerm`](@ref) | `extrapolation = :dream` | the default behaviour matches DREAM, a code used by researchers in the field |
| radiation mode of [`RadiatedPowerTerm`](@ref) | `radiation = :recombination` | - |

Inside the tables the interpolation is bicubic in ``\log_{10}`` of the coefficient over ``\log_{10} n`` and ``\log_{10} T``.
`extrapolation = :dream` continues the bilinear interpolation of ``\log_{10}`` of the coefficient in ``\log_{10} n`` and ``\log_{10} T`` from the edge cell, as DREAM's `ADASRateInterpolator` does.
`extrapolation = :clamp_density` clamps the density to the table and extrapolates in ``T`` alone; at low densities the coefficients are those of the lowest tabulated density, near the coronal limit.
The radiation takes the ADAS classes PLT (line radiation) and PRB (recombination radiation and bremsstrahlung).
`radiation = :recombination` takes PLT + PRB and accounts for the binding energy of every ionization and recombination.
`radiation = :dream` is DREAM's default: PLT, the ionization loss and the bremsstrahlung of R. J. Gould, The Astrophysical Journal 238, 1026 (1980), [doi:10.1086/158068](https://doi.org/10.1086/158068).
The erratum is The Astrophysical Journal 243, 677 (1981), [doi:10.1086/158634](https://doi.org/10.1086/158634).
It reproduces DREAM's radiation with `bremsstrahlung_corrections = :dream`, which takes DREAM's coefficients of Gould's corrections.

## Plasma from the unknowns

| Choice | Value |
|---|---|
| floor of a temperature unknown | [`DEFAULT_TEMPERATURE_FLOOR`](@ref) = 0.5 eV |

The floor is the default of [`PlasmaFromUnknowns`](@ref) and of [`fluid_temperature_floors`](@ref).
DREAM has no floor, so a comparison that follows DREAM below 0.5 eV sets a lower value.

## Grids

| Choice | Value |
|---|---|
| pitch grid of [`runaway_grid`](@ref) | [`biuniform_theta_xi_faces`](@ref)`(20, 12, 0.9)`: 12 cells uniform in ``\theta \in [0, 0.9]`` rad and 8 up to ``\pi`` |

The cells are finest near ``\xi = 1``, the direction of the runaway beam.
The pitch grid of the runaway grid is the same at all radii and independent of that of the hot-tail grid ([Grids](model/grids.md)).

## Knock-on cutoff

| Choice | Value |
|---|---|
| rule of [`cutoff_target`](@ref) | ``W_\mathrm{cut} = \sqrt{T W_c}`` where the critical momentum is finite and ``W_c > T``, else `no_ceiling_factor` times ``T`` |
| factor of the cutoff without a threshold | `no_ceiling_factor = 10` |
| placement of [`KnockOnCutoffUpdate`](@ref) | `placement = :energy_midpoint` |
| lower bound of the window of [`cutoff_window`](@ref) and of `placement = :window`, in units of the thermal momentum | `thermal_factor = 4` |

``W_\mathrm{cut}`` is the kinetic energy at the cutoff and ``W_c`` that at the critical momentum ``p_c``, by default from [`total_critical_momentum`](@ref).
[`KnockOnCutoffUpdate`](@ref) applies the rule at the start of the run and after every accepted step, at every radius (`per_radius = true`).
In DREAM the cutoff (`pCutAvalanche`) is fixed within a run and changes only between restarts.
The cutoff is a face of the knock-on grid, kept while the target lies between its neighbouring faces ([`choose_cutoff_face`](@ref)).
The lower bound keeps the cutoff above the thermal momentum, so that the momentum and energy that the knock-on source creates without a matching loss stay small.
DREAM's documentation gives an upper bound for `pCutAvalanche`, the critical momentum, and no lower bound.

## Linear solvers

| Choice | Value |
|---|---|
| restart length of [`GMRES`](@ref) | `restart_length = 50` |
| linear solver of [`NewtonSolver`](@ref) | `linear_solver = SparseLU()`, UMFPACK ([`SparseLU`](@ref)) |
| refinement steps of [`MKLPardiso`](@ref) | `refinement_steps = 0` |
| largest relative residual of a solve of [`MKLPardiso`](@ref) | `MAX_RELATIVE_RESIDUAL = 1e-6` of `Runes2PMKLPardisoExt` |

When a step needs more Krylov iterations than the restart length, restarted GMRES can stagnate, and the step ends with `:linear_solve_failed`.
The Krylov basis holds `restart_length` vectors.

UMFPACK comes with Julia's standard library SparseArrays, so the default needs no MKL.
Its timings against MKL PARDISO ([`MKLPardiso`](@ref)) are on the page [Performance and accuracy](performance.md#The-linear-solvers).
DREAM's default solver is PETSc's own LU (`LINEAR_SOLVER_LU`).

On the disruption case, ten refinement steps of PARDISO cost more than a factorization ([Performance and accuracy](performance.md#The-linear-solvers)).
Without them the relative residual of a solve is 1.0e-9, below the `floor_linear_tolerance` of 1e-8 of [`NewtonSolver`](@ref).
DREAM's MKL PARDISO solver allows 10 refinement steps (`fvm/Solvers/MIMKL.cpp`), which `MKLPardiso(refinement_steps = 10)` reproduces.

PARDISO perturbs a small pivot instead of failing, so a singular or nearly singular matrix gives a finite solution whose residual is large.
A solve of [`MKLPardiso`](@ref) whose relative residual exceeds `MAX_RELATIVE_RESIDUAL` fails with `:singular_matrix`, as a zero pivot does with [`SparseLU`](@ref).
The step is then retried shorter at once.
The table gives the relative residuals of PARDISO's solves that the bound separates.

| Matrices | Relative residual of a solve |
|---|---|
| the Newton matrices of the disruption case | 1e-13 to 1e-9 |
| the bound `MAX_RELATIVE_RESIDUAL` | 1e-6 |
| singular matrices | 1e-2 to 10 |
| a matrix of the pattern, solved with the ordering and the matching of another | just above the bound, or far above 1 |

- The bound lies three orders of magnitude above the residuals of the disruption case.
- It lies four or more orders of magnitude below the residuals of singular matrices.
- A false failure costs a shorter step.
- The solve after a failure computes a new ordering and matching.

## Time stepping

| Choice | Value |
|---|---|
| next step of [`StepDoubling`](@ref) after a step that an unknown at zero fails while every other unknown has no error | half the step |
| round-off bound of a residual row of [`NewtonSolver`](@ref) on a stiff step | `c = 1` in the bound `c eps Σ_j abs((∂F/∂u)_ij u_j)` |
| Newton iteration after an iterate that passes both tests with negative entries in a kinetic unknown | one more for the schemes of [`POLISHED_SCHEMES`](@ref), turned off after [`POLISH_MISSES`](@ref) steps in a row that it does not clean, `polish_negatives = :auto` of [`NewtonSolver`](@ref) |

DREAM rejects a step in which an unknown with no absolute tolerance is zero after the full step and not after the two half steps.
It takes the next step from the largest error of the other unknowns, as [`StepDoubling`](@ref) does.
When that error is zero, DREAM's next step is unbounded; halving the step tried keeps the retry finite.
DREAM has no finite behaviour to reproduce there, so no option gives DREAM's.

The round-off bound counts each term of a residual row at its own size, one rounding error per term.
A row whose terms cancel to many digits cannot fall below it, whatever the iterate.
With `c = 1` the bound lies about 2.5 times above the largest residual measured at the floor, in the quench of the disruption case at DREAM's resolution.
DREAM converges on the update alone and only warns about the residual ([Comparison with DREAM](dream-comparison.md)), so it has no residual test to waive.

A positivity-preserving limiter keeps the converged discrete solution non-negative, and the extra iteration converges it further where an accepted iterate still has negative entries ([Positivity](model/positivity.md#Convergence-of-the-limiter)).
The schemes of [`POLISHED_SCHEMES`](@ref) are those whose converged solution stayed non-negative in the tests; the extra iteration is wasted on the others.
An unconverged limiter is cleaned by one extra iteration, so [`POLISH_MISSES`](@ref), five misses in a row, shows a scheme that does not keep the run non-negative and bounds the cost of finding out.
DREAM takes no such iteration: `polish_negatives = false`.

## Examples

The parameter values of the scripts of `examples/` come from DREAM's examples or are choices of this package, cited in each script.

| Script | Momentum cells, `p_max` | Pitch cells | Plasma | Time step |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `examples/common.jl`, switch `grid=biuniform_270` | 270 to ``p = 2.5``, 70 of them below ``p = 0.07`` ([`biuniform_p_faces`](@ref)) | 15, 10 of them within 0.5 rad of ``\xi = 1`` ([`biuniform_theta_xi_faces`](@ref)) | - | - |
| `examples/relaxation.jl` | 200 to ``p = 2`` | 15 | deuterium at ``T = 1`` keV and ``n = 10^{20}`` m⁻³, ``E = 5 E_c`` | ``\Delta t = 10^{-5}`` s up to ``t = 1`` ms |
| `examples/cooling.jl` | 200 to ``p = 2`` | 15 | that of `reference/dream/cases/cooling_positivity.py` | ``\Delta t = 10^{-5}`` s |

The `grid=biuniform_270` preset is a fully kinetic hot-tail grid.
In `examples/relaxation.jl` ``E_c`` is the Connor–Hastie critical field ([`critical_field`](@ref)), and the field lies between the critical and the Dreicer field.
The plasma of `examples/cooling.jl` is that of the reference case `reference/dream/cases/cooling_positivity.py`.
Its radial values come from DREAM's SPI example.

## Reference cases

This section holds the choices of two reference cases: the disruption chain and the case `heating`.

### The disruption chain

The reference case `reference/dream/cases/disruption_kinetic.py` runs the disruption chain of DREAM's `examples/Disruptions/generate.py` with the parameters of `examples/Disruptions/ASDEXU.py`.
Its options and their values are in the table, with one note per row below it.

| Choice | Value |
|---|---|
| scenario of the disruption chain | `--scenario 1`, the full-conversion scenario |
| elongation of the radial grid | `--elongation 1`, a cylinder without shaping |
| steps of phase 1 | `--nt-ioniz 500`, steps of 4e-8 s |
| runaway grid (`--runaway-grid`) | the default grid of the table of runaway grids below |
| runaway grid of the measurement of scenario 4 at full size | `--re-pmax 200 --re-np-coarse 40 --re-nxi 15 --re-nxi-sep 10` |
| advection scheme of `f_re` | that of `f_hot` (`--scheme`) in both phases |
| absolute tolerance of `f_re` | 1e5 from run 1 on, that of `f_hot` in the phases |
| window of phase 2 of the test | `--window-start 170 --window-steps 10` |

- Scenario: the DREAM paper runs scenarios 1 and 4.
  `generate.py` runs scenario 0 by default, which `--scenario 0` reproduces.
- Elongation: the cylinder of Runes2P has no shaping.
  `ASDEXU.py` takes an elongation linear from 1.0 to 1.15 in the radius, which `--elongation asdexu` reproduces.
- Steps of phase 1: the 500 steps are passed with `--elongation 1`, and the default of the script stays the 200 steps of scenario 1.
  Each step of phase 1 is then 4e-8 s instead of 1e-7 s.
  With 200 steps DREAM's first step fails in runs with `--linear-solver mkl`, also when retried, since its Newton iteration meets a non-finite value (`brent.c:69: computed function value is infinite or NaN`).
  The step of 4e-8 s is also that of the case at the size of a test in `test/test_disruption_dream.jl`.
- Runaway grid: DREAM's example runs no runaway grid.
  The defaults of `--runaway-grid` serve scenario 1 at the reduced size of the tests.
  At 300 µs of scenario 1, a grid to `p_max = 60` holds 3e-5 of the density of `f_re` above `p = 20`.
  The avalanche source keeps a small population up to the last cell, so a few cells more do not change the result.
  The 8 pitch cells, fine near `ξ = 1`, differ from the 4 uniform cells of the hot-tail grid, so that a test crosses DREAM's mapping between the two pitch grids.
- Runaway grid of scenario 4: the measurement of scenario 4 at full size ([The whole quench of scenario 4](dream-comparison.md#The-whole-quench-of-scenario-4)) takes the grid to `p_max = 200`.
  The reason is in the table of `p_max` below.
- Advection scheme: the scheme of `f_hot` on `f_re`, with its switch to upwind in phase 2 where `generate.py` makes it, keeps one scheme across the interface.
  DREAM's own default for `f_re` is the centred scheme.
- Absolute tolerance: `generate.py` sets no absolute tolerance for `f_re`, and DREAM sets none either (`ToleranceSettings.py`).
  The case gives `f_re` the 1e5 of `f_hot`.
- Window: the window is described in [The window of the test](#The-window-of-the-test).
  The default of `--window-steps` is 10.

The runaway grids have a fine segment above the hot-tail `p_max` of 0.8 and a geometric segment above it.
The momenta are in units of ``m_e c``.

| Grid | Segment | Momentum cells | From `p` | To `p` | Cell width |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| default | fine | 12 | 0.8 | 2 | 0.1 |
| default | geometric | 20 | 2 | 20 | growing, the first 0.1 (from 2.0 to 2.1) |
| scenario 4 at full size | fine | 12 | 0.8 | 2 | 0.1 |
| scenario 4 at full size | geometric | 40 | 2 | 200 | growing |

- The default grid has 8 pitch cells, biuniform in θ.
  5 of them lie below θ = 0.5.
- The grid of scenario 4 has 15 pitch cells (`--re-nxi 15 --re-nxi-sep 10`).

The table compares runs of DREAM v26.5 in scenario 4 with three values of the `p_max` of the runaway grid.

| `p_max` | `n_re` held in `f_re` at the centre at the end of the quench | `I_p` at 4.99e-3 s, 3200 steps | Relative difference of `I_p` |
|---|---|---|---|
| 20, the default of the case script | 0.44 of `n_re` | - | - |
| 60 | - | 2.5305347e5 A | −4.5e-5 |
| 200 | share above the grid: [Comparison with DREAM](dream-comparison.md#The-whole-quench-of-scenario-4) | 2.5306492e5 A | the reference |

- The relative difference is (`I_p` − `I_p` at `p_max = 200`) / `I_p` at `p_max = 200`.
- The default grid holds too little of `n_re` in scenario 4, so the measurement takes the grid to `p_max = 200`.

### The window of the test

The window is the part of phase 2 that the test of the runaway grid runs from DREAM's state.
It runs on the reduced grid of the tests with the step of the scenario.
The table compares phase 2 of the case with that of scenario 1 and with the short phases of `DISRUPTION_ARGS` in `reference/dream/run_all.sh`.

| Run | Options | Duration of phase 2 | Steps | Step |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| the case at the reduced size of the tests | `--nt-quench 429 --t-quench 3e-4` | 3e-4 s | 429 | 6.527e-7 s |
| scenario 1 of `generate.py` | `t_TQ` 1e-3, `t_ioniz` 2e-5, `nt_TQ` 1500 | 9.8e-4 s | 1500 | 6.533e-7 s |
| `DISRUPTION_ARGS` of `reference/dream/run_all.sh` | `--nt-quench 10 --t-quench 1.4e-6` | 1.4e-6 s | 10 | - |

- The step of the case is that of scenario 1.
- Phase 2 of the case ends at 300 µs, the end of the benchmark of scenario 1.

| Quantity | Window | Criterion |
|---|---|---|
| first step | 170 | - |
| time of the scenario at the first step | 131.0 µs | 130 to 150 µs |
| runaway share of the plasma current at the first step | 5.9 % | 1 to 10 % |
| steps | 10 | - |
| run time of the whole chain | 10.5 s | - |
| test data of the window | 95.9 kB | - |

- The window starts where `f_re` carries part of the current.
- The column Criterion gives the ranges that the start of the window is chosen to lie in.
- Ten steps keep the reference small.

### The case `heating`

The case `heating` of the reference case `reference/dream/cases/initial_state.py` runs the runaway grid of DREAM's `examples/init_f_re/generate.py`.
The test case `runaway_heating_example` (`test/example_cases.jl`) builds it.
The table holds the choices of that case.

| Choice | Value |
|---|---|
| length of the run | 5e-6 s in the 20 steps of the example, in place of its 1e-3 s |
| start of ``f_\mathrm{re}`` | `INIT_FORWARD` from ``n_\mathrm{re} = 10^{16}`` m⁻³, in place of the analytic avalanche shape of the example |
| cold temperature | self-consistent from 100 eV, `TYPE_SELFCONSISTENT`, in place of the prescribed temperature of the example |

The run of 5e-6 s keeps ``T_\mathrm{cold}`` near the 100 eV of the example: the ohmic heating raises it to 101.4 eV.
With the self-consistent temperature DREAM's equation of ``T_\mathrm{cold}`` holds the collisional heating by ``f_\mathrm{re}`` (`src/Settings/Equations/T_cold.cpp:341-354`), which the case saves with the states it is evaluated from.
