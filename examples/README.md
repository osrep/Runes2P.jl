# Examples

This folder holds basic runs of the methods in the code, one script each.
Each script takes `name=value` switches on the command line, and its defaults run as they are.
The environment is `examples/Project.toml`, with Runes2P from the parent directory and HDF5 for the output:

```sh
julia --project=examples -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'   # once
julia --project=examples examples/relaxation.jl
julia --project=examples examples/cooling.jl scheme=van_albada solver=gmres
julia --project=examples examples/avalanche.jl treatment=implicit solver=gmres
```

## The scripts

| Script | Run | Report |
|---|---|---|
| `relaxation.jl` | a Maxwellian under a fixed plasma and field (Dreicer regime by default) | with `p_star=`, the fraction above that momentum |
| `cooling.jl` | the temperature decays from `T=` to `T_final=` over `t_end=` | where a scheme goes negative |
| `avalanche.jl` | knock-on multiplication of a 100 keV seed on DREAM's avalanche example | the growth rate |

- `relaxation.jl`: `T0=` sets a seed temperature different from the plasma's.
- `cooling.jl`: the collision coefficients follow the temperature.
  With `nr=`, that many radii are coupled by radial diffusion of strength `dbb=`.
- `avalanche.jl`: `treatment=` takes `explicit_primary` (the default), `explicit` or `implicit`.
  `cutoff=` sets the knock-on cutoff.

## What a script prints and writes

Each script prints the solver statistics, the negative entries of the saved states and the density at every save.
The statistics are these:

- The steps.
- The Newton and Krylov iterations.
- The factorizations.
- The steps accepted at the residual floor or as a linear system.
- The steps polished for negatives.

`output=run.h5` writes the solution with `write_output`.
The file holds the layout, the saved states per unknown, the solver statistics, and the settings of the run with the commit of Runes2P.

## Switches

The switches are shared through `common.jl`.

### Notes on the grids and schemes

- `grid=biuniform_270` is a fully kinetic hot-tail grid of 270 momentum cells to p = 2.5.
  Of these, 70 lie below p = 0.07.
  It has 15 pitch cells, and 10 of them lie within 0.5 rad of ξ = 1.
  It is a choice of this package (see the docs page *Choices of this package*).
- `pitch=theta` is biuniform in the pitch angle, with `nxi_low=` cells within `theta_sep=` radians of ξ = 1.
- The schemes up to `upwind_second_order` are linear in f.
  The rest are flux limiters, which are nonlinear.
- `jacobian=exact` takes the exact Jacobian by automatic differentiation.
- `jacobian=frozen_limiter` freezes the limiter at the iterate (DREAM `AD_INTERP_JACOBIAN_LINEAR`).
- `jacobian=upwind`, `central` and `exponential_fitting` take the Jacobian of that linear scheme.
  `upwind` is DREAM `AD_INTERP_JACOBIAN_UPWIND`.
- `avalanche.jl` uses the collision settings of its example.

The first four values of `pmax_boundary=` are DREAM's boundary conditions at `p_max`.

| `pmax_boundary=` | DREAM |
|---|---|
| `f_zero` | `BC_F_0` |
| `constant_flux` | `BC_PHI_CONST` |
| `extrapolated_flux` | `BC_DPHI_CONST` |
| `extrapolated_flux_consistent` | the consistent form of `BC_DPHI_CONST` |

### Notes on the solver and the run

- `operator=exact` uses the approximate stored Jacobian only as a preconditioner.
- `operator=stored` iterates with the stored matrix, a quasi-Newton iteration as in DREAM.
- `checkpoint_interval=` is 1800 s by default.
- `resume=true` continues from the last checkpoint when there is one.
- `overwrite=true` lets a run replace the segment files of an earlier one.
- The segment stops at a time point when the file of `stop_file=` appears or the budget of `wall_budget=` runs out.
- In a Slurm job with checkpoints, the end of the job (`SLURM_JOB_END_TIME`) is the budget.
- `log=` with a file name appends the log to that file.

### The lower limit

`nonnegative=true` follows DREAM's rule.

- A Newton step may remove at most 90% of an entry's distance to zero.
- A step that would push an entry already at zero below it fails and is retried with half the time step.

A Maxwellian tail underflows to exact zeros, so with this switch a run rejects and halves many steps.
This is the rule at work, not a fault.

## Parameter values and schemes

Parameter values come from DREAM's examples or are choices of this package (see the docs page *Choices of this package*), cited in each script.

The default scheme, exponential fitting, keeps f non-negative at every resolution.
It is first order where a smooth tail is driven by the field.
So field-driven quantities need a check against a finer `np=`: the runaway fraction of `relaxation.jl` at large `e_over_ec`, and the loss through `p_max` in `cooling.jl`.
The limiters converge faster there and cost more per step.
DREAM's default is the central value (`AD_INTERP_CENTRED` in DREAM's `py/DREAM/Settings/Equations/DistributionFunction.py`), and its other choices include the flux limiters.
